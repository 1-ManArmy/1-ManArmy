## About

I design and build intelligent systems and secure software with a focus on reliability, privacy, and responsible disclosure. I combine applied machine learning, automation, and large-scale system design to deliver pragmatic research and production-ready tools.

I value:
- Clear thinking and careful implementation  
- Ethical security research and coordinated disclosure  
- Reproducible experiments and robust infrastructure

### 🧠 **I talk to AI. It listens. It learns. It obeys.**  
💻 **Making machines think, breaking security walls.**  
🚀 **AI | Cybersecurity | NeuroTech | Ethical Hacking**  
😏 **Sometimes I build, sometimes I hack. Always I win.**  
📍 **Find me where the code runs & the fire burns.**  
💻 **Building AI that thinks, learns & dominates.**  
🔐 **Breaking barriers in security & automation.**  
😏 **Living in code, thriving in intelligence.**  
👉 **Work Hard, Hack Smart, Stay Untraceable.**

## Selected Projects

### GHQ — Intelligent Data Fetch
A modular data collection and enrichment platform designed to pull, normalize, and serve data for downstream ML pipelines. Focuses on reliability, data quality, and observability.

### Multi-Agent AI Hub
A framework for hosting multiple agent personas & models, with pluggable backends for commercial and open-source LLMs. Emphasizes safe defaults, rate limiting, and auditable logs.

### Security Research & Tooling
Tools and notes from responsibly conducted assessments and red-team exercises. All findings are handled via coordinated disclosure channels.

> _Project details available in individual repos. For sensitive materials or exploit code, reach out for responsible access._

## Philosophy

I build with intent and operate with integrity. The goal is not spectacle — it is dependable systems and clear improvements. I practice and promote:
- Responsible disclosure and ethical research  
- Test-driven development and reproducibility  
- Documentation, observability, and maintainability

---

## Tech Stack

- Languages: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash  
- ML: PyTorch, Hugging Face ecosystem, model orchestration tools  
- Web: Flask, FastAPI, Next.js (when needed)  
- Infra: Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx, MySQL/Postgres, Redis  
- CI/CD & Monitoring: GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana

---

## How to Work With Me

- Open to collaboration on ML systems, automation pipelines, and security engineering projects.  
- For vulnerability reports or sensitive matters, please use coordinated disclosure channels and include reproduction steps, impact, and suggested mitigations.  
- I prefer written introductions with scope and expected outcomes.
